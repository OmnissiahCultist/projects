## Ideas
More so a place for me to organize my thoughts and reference for inspiration.

- [Calendar Service]()  
  Webscraper calendar. Local > Nationwide > Global.

  
## In progress
Projects still underway.

- [Active Directory Home Lab]()  
  Active Directory Lab work.


## Completed
Personal projects that I have finished or am satisfied with the results.

- [OSINT Investigation (Phishing) Blogpost](https://github.com/OmnissiahCultist/OSINT_investigation_phishing)  
  A blog post detailing my experience using OSINT tools to investigate a phishing attempt and identify suspicious connections. Real world example but the actual individuals involved will not be referenced in order to discourage exploitation/abuse.


## Archived
Indefinite inaction, dropped projects because they got picked up in a seperate way or I gained what I wanted from the experience. I am saving the past versions like a time capsule to gain insight on my approaches then vs now as I continue too learn more.

- [One-Time Pad Code](https://github.com/OmnissiahCultist/One-time-pad-python-practice)  
  A project to replicate the steps of creating a one-time pad encryption method.

- [Hardening Flask Webapp + SQL DB](https://github.com/OmnissiahCultist/Webapp_Securing_Project)  
  A project exploring webapp and database communications, deployment methods, and security hardening techniques.
